OVERVIEW
========

1. get root
2. get python
3. script your car.

There are two methods to get root (which are not exclusive to each other);
either with the serial port, changing the root password to something known,
or by booting from a microSD card.

KL15
====

In order to make the device boot at all, a message needs to be received over
CAN that enables the main CPU. One way is to just leave the HT-5 connected
in a car, another is to attach a CAN adapter and send the following message:

ID 661, 0300000000000000

Use can use KiSim for this.

GETTING ROOT, VIA USB MASS STORAGE
==================================

The simplest way to get root is this:

Buy a USB Micro-B OTG adapter. They are usually sold for Android devices,
and are pretty cheap in the usual places. Make sure they connect the ID pin
correctly (but really, most of them do).

Get a FAT32-formatted USB mass storage stick, and place noveroexec.sh on it
(root directory).

On the HT-5, there is a small plastic latch (no need to open the device!)
which hides a USB micro-B plug. Plugin the USB stick, and a few seconds
later, you should see a message on the display (make sure to switch to the
phone screen first) (*).

After that, a user named 'r00t' has been created, with empty password. You
can now login using that user via serial port.

TODO:
 - open up network to allow connection via WiFi
 - change USB OTG port to RNDIS to allow connnection over RNDIS

There is a commented-out function in noveroexec.sh that switches the OTG
port to rndis, but it reset the USB port, so the mass storage gets
enumerated again, causing a (harmless) loop until you unplug the device.

(*) NOTE, as of now, I only tested this with KiSim.

GETTING ROOT, VIA SERIAL
========================

There are multiple options of obtaining root access to the HT-5.

One way is to boot into a failover system that's already in flash, and then
rw-mount the real rootfs, changing the password.

This requires accesing the SERIAL PORT. Power up the device, send the
KL15 message, and keep hammering Ctrl+C to interrupt U-Boot.


1. boot into failover system
> setenv bootargs ${bootargs} set_rootfs=generic@flash
> boot


2. mount real rootfs read-writable
> mkdir /rootfs
> mount -t jffs2 -o rw /dev/mtdblock0 /rootfs
> cd /rootfs/etc


3. add a custom user without a password
> echo "rootnopwd::0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh" >> /rootfs/etc/passwd

4. unmount rootfs
> cd /
> umount /rootfs


5. reboot normally, and use the new user.

GETTING ROOT, VIA MICROSD ROOTFS
=================================

This is to-be-completed.

The idea is to create a rootfs on a MicroSD card, which the
HT-5 will boot from. (You need to add the MicroSD slot, so it requires a bit
of soldering. Other than the slot itself, no other hardware is necessary
(though there is an unpopulated bias cap which might be a good idea to
populate.) The slot is on the bottom side, in the middle, opposite to the
car connector.) You can then either run the regular rootfs, and add a full
chroot on the SD-Card (with python), or run your own rootfs, and integrate
all of the existing services.

The rdinit script tries to boot from /dev/mmcblk0p2, so you need to create
two partitions, with the first partition being the root partition.

An easy way to create a rootfs is using emdebian's multistrap, which can be
done like this:

# install multistrap, qemu
apt-get install multistrap dpkg-dev binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static
# bootstrap emdebian image
multistrap -a armel -d $PWD/RFS -f multistrap.conf
# install qemu to finish the installation
cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static RFS/usr/bin
# chroot into new rootfs
chroot RFS /bin/bash
# fixup isntgallation
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBCONF_NONINTERACTIVE_SEEN=true
export LC_ALL=C LANGUAGE=C LANG=C
/var/lib/dpkg/info/dash.preinst install
dpkg --configure -a
mount proc -t proc /proc
dpkg --configure -a

# add serial shell
echo "T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 115200 vt100" >> /etc/inittab
mknod /dev/ttyS0 c 4 64 # or rely on udev

# create init
ln /sbin/init /init

# enable root user
passwd

exit

Then, move this rootfs into an ext2/3 fs as the SECOND partition on a microSD
card. Plug it into the HT-5, and it should boot:

[...]
[    3.961975] Freeing init memory: 568K
Try android generic rootfs on flash mmc0 mmc1 nand nfs device ...
extract init img from /dev/mtdblock0...
extract init img from /dev/mmcblk0...
try to boot from /dev/mmcblk0p2...
[    4.537536] EXT3-fs: barriers not enabled
[   18.977691] kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
[   19.948699] EXT3-fs (mmcblk0p2): mounted filesystem with writeback data mode
clean before boot to rootfs...
INIT: version 2.88 booting
Using makefile-style concurrent boot in runlevel S.
Setting the system clock.
[...]

You should then boot into a regular emdebian rootfs, and finally get a
serial console:

Debian GNU/Linux 7 192.168.1.101 ttyS0

192 login:

However there is nothing yet that refreshes the s12x watchdog, so at some
point, the system will reboot.

FIXME: emdebian's udev is incompatible, since the kernel doesn't have accept4.
I will not spend time on fixing udev's really stupid issues. udev just showed
itself as a showstopper. Live with it. "Upgrade your kernel" is the usual
response for complains. Good luck in upgrading your kernel.

[Or really: just get rid of udev.]

TODO: boot into a shell script that mounts /dev/mtdblock0, copies everything
to SD card, and boots from there.

SERIAL PORT
===========

The serial port is available as test points, or on the car connector:

23 - RX
24 - TX

It's a regular LVTTL UART.
